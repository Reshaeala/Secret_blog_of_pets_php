(EXAMPLE OF WHAT I SAID IF IT HELPS... "Added timestamps and tried for many hours to get Moment.js to convert them. But even with Dan's help, I wasn't able to get there. The best I got was getting the "createdAt" time (created by the timestamp) to appear on the page...but as we know, that's not very human friendly.")
